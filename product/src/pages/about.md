When covid-19 shut down the world a lot of people began to rely heavily on the internet for connection. Myself and many others started to take interest in just how the internet works and how its contents are made. This created a surge of new enthusiasts using the internet to become more technically adept. That's how I started my journey into coding and web development. This website was my first to actually make it online and was my introduction to the world of blogging. I wanted to be able to write about the technologies I was learning. As I only feel I understand something when I can explain it to someone else. For me, that's the best way to solidify the information.</p> 

Hi I am Oliver,  

<p class="left">
I love to create static websites because they are fast, secure and easy to update. In fact, up to 6x faster than the average website with a backend. The most secure form of website you can have. Updates take a few seconds before they are live on your site. These sites are feature rich, with responsive design that's mobile friendly. Hitting all check marks for on page SEO. These types of webpages are best suited but not limited to blogs, business pages, artist profiles and software documentation.</p>  
Let me know if I can help you get yourself or your business online today.
