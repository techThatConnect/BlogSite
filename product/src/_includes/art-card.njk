            <p>I had been learning web development, on my own for about a year, and want to see a project through from start to finish. I always loved writing as a kid and a blog site appeared simple enough. It will be a place to collect my thoughts and hopefully help someone else along the way. Since I am starting a blog, why not write about the process? I am fairly new to development, so this is a great way for me to document my development as a developer(say that five times fast). I put this series on the site as its first set of archives. I’ll walk you through the tools I used why I made the decisions I did and how they affected the final product.</p>

            <h3>So what’s important for a blog site?</h3>
                    <p > Easy to update, fast to load and has a well organized content filing system that’s searchable. After looking at different site architectures I decided to construct the site using a JAM (javascript, apis and markup) stack with a SSG or static site generator.  For this I chose 11ty, a node package installed locally in my working directory. Each article will be a markdown file that will be rendered as its own html page. For more information on what an SSG is and why I chose 11ty stay tuned for the next installment of this series.
