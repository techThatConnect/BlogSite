summary: Since this is tech that connect, let's take that literally and look at a piece of technology over 100 years old that is still in use today. We often call them patch cables but they are technically 1/4" phone jacks. As the name implies they were first used in telephone switch boards to route (or "patch") phone calls.  While patented in 1901 use of this cable or one very similar can be traced back as far as 1878. In the 1950s a 3.5mm size of the same jack was created to facilitate technology getting smaller. Today 1/4" are most associated with electric guitars and 3.5mm with headphones or aux cables.
